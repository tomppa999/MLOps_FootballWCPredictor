# WC 2026 Live Log

Daily notes during the tournament (June 11 – July 19, 2026).
Maps to thesis Chapter 5 (RQ1–RQ3 results) and Chapter 3 (threats to validity).

Format: one entry per meaningful event (pipeline run, refit, failure, anomaly).
Granularity: don't log every 30-min inference cycle — log deviations, failures,
and end-of-matchday summaries.

## Pre-tournament deployment (Jun 1–10)

- Jun 9: GCP dress rehearsal (C.9 first pass) — dual-mode dispatch ran (frozen + per_round), metadata tags landed, `predictions_all_models.csv` covered all 4 models, DVC push succeeded. Clean run = gold 6921 rows.
- Jun 10: every-2h cadence test on live friendly data — validated scheduler mechanics (~50-min run vs 120-min interval), reverted to daily afterwards.
- Jun 11: final C.9 pass (`inference_only`) — both cadence modes ran, both artifact sets written.
- Jun 11: Both MLflow aliases resolve (`champion_frozen`, `champion_per_round`)? **Y** — both point at the frozen snapshot (display champion xgboost).
- Jun 11: DVC push from container succeeded? **Y** (verified Jun 9; Jun 11 local push also succeeded post-DagsHub-recovery).
- Jun 11: Monitoring runs appear empty pre-WC? **Y** — `No settled WC 2026 matches yet — monitoring no-op`.

## Matchday 1 — Group Stage Round 1 (Jun 11–12)

Matches played: [fill]

Pipeline:
- Both modes logged inference artifacts? **Y** (pre-kickoff C.9 pass; Gold 6945 rows).
- `champion_frozen` run_id used: `5f5a313ad5c14199aef0a791d2e4041a` (v15, xgboost, gold_row_count=6945; `4f6ce4f0808b43fcb68d4acf10c5f1a8` was the inference cycle run_id, not the champion model run_id) (per_round inference: `5272ce72261043228b1455b0a06ed5cb`).
- `champion_per_round` refit fired at MD1 boundary? [fill — fires on first settled results, 0 → 1 boundary]
  - New `champion_per_round` run_id after refit: [fill]
  - Gold rows at refit time: [fill]
- Any failures or anomalies: **DagsHub maintenance outage on go-live day** (~09:46–~19:5x UTC). Git + artifact service down: crashed the first C.9 `inference_only` run at `git push`, then blocked all artifact reads/writes (HTTP 500 on `artifacts/list` and download, for every run). Re-ran C.9 successfully after git recovered; dashboard/artifact access restored once the `mlflow-artifacts` proxy came back. Freeze stayed intact throughout (Gold unchanged at 6945 rows, run metadata healthy, aliases correct).
- **Jun 12: post-Match-1 inference cycle crashed** — duplicate `fixture_id` when `wc_results_to_gold_rows` returned Match 1's result as a stub while the nightly pipeline had already landed it in Gold. `pd.concat` produced two rows with the same `fixture_id`; `add_days_since_last_match` then set a non-unique index, corrupting feature output. Fixed in commit `b8f9c5a6` (deduplication guard in `run.py` + defensive `drop_duplicates` in `temporal_features.py`), deployed as image `20260612a`. First successful monitoring cycle ran after Match 2. Post-fix: pipeline auto-commits resumed normally (multiple `data: auto-update pipeline 2026-06-12` commits confirm stable hourly cycles).
- **Jun 12: `champion_per_round` refitted prematurely (v16 / local v8)** — two compounding causes: (1) the frozen champion run (v15/v7) had no `per_round_refit_matchday` tag, so `_last_per_round_refit_matchday()` defaulted to `"0"`; (2) `next_matchday` advances to `"2"` as soon as the *first* group-stage match settles (`max_group_matchday + 1` logic in `features.py`), not after all 24 MD1 games are done (12 groups × 2). Combined: condition `"2" != "0"` fired on the first `auto`-mode pipeline run after Match 1 settled, retraining on only 6946 Gold rows (+1 vs frozen). **For MD1 analysis: use `champion_frozen` predictions for both cadence modes** — v16 is a premature artefact and carries no meaningful new information.
- **Jun 14: fix deployed (image `20260614a`)** — gate switched to a new `per_round_last_completed_matchday` tag (keyed on a fully-completed round, not `next_matchday`). The new signal is derived from `parse_wc_results` counting scheduled vs finished fixtures per round; the refit fires only when `finished >= scheduled > 0` for a full round, propagating in order MD1 → MD2 → MD3 → R32 → R16 → QF → SF → Final. v16's stale `per_round_refit_matchday = "2"` tag is irrelevant to the new gate (it reads a different tag, defaulting to `"0"` for v16), so the next correct refit will fire as soon as all 24 MD1 fixtures are settled. No double-fire: a completed round is tagged on the new model version and skipped on subsequent ticks. See commit `44dbd481`.
- **Jun 14: monitoring efficiency improvement (image `20260614b`)** — monitoring now skips MLflow re-logging when the settled match count is unchanged since the last cycle (gate queries `n_scored_matches` from the most recent monitoring run; fails safe to "log anyway" if DagsHub is unreachable), and per-match metric writes are batched into a single `log_batch` call instead of one HTTP request per metric. Reduces the monitoring phase from ~12 min to <1 s on no-change ticks. See commit `b814beaf`.

Observations:
- First 2 matches scored across all 8 models × 2 cadence modes. Match 1 (MX 2–0 SA): all team-aware models correct direction (p_home 71–79%), RF and SARIMAX best RPS (~0.024–0.027). Match 2 (KOR 2–1 CZE): near-coin-flip, ridge/sarimax overestimated Czechia (λ_a ≈ 1.40 vs actual 1 goal), RF best (RPS 0.256). `mean_rate_poisson` non-competitive on Match 1 (RPS 0.267 — no team-strength signal), trivially middle-of-pack on the coin-flip Match 2. Cumulative RPS after 2 matches: RF 0.140, XGB 0.154, negbin_glm 0.163 — all well clear of the 0.235 naive floor. No alert window breach possible yet (need 24 scored matches). Frozen and per_round predictions are identical (cadence not yet diverged; `champion_per_round` refit has not fired).
